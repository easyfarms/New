### 👥 ## 👥 **e‑Yantra Team Formation Guide**

Team formation is one of the most important steps in the e‑Yantra Robotics Competition. Here’s everything you need to know to build a competitive, collaborative, and rule-compliant team:

---

### ✅ 1. **Team Size**

* Each team must consist of a **minimum of 2 members** and a **maximum of 4 members**.
* All team members **must belong to the same college/institution**. This ensures smoother communication, shared lab access, and aligned academic schedules.

> 🟡 Example:
> You and 3 classmates from the same college can form a 4-member team.
> You **cannot** add a friend from another college.

---

### 🧑‍💼 2. **Team Roles**

While there's no strict rule on assigning roles, e‑Yantra **highly recommends** that teams define internal responsibilities to improve efficiency. Here’s a suggested breakdown:

| Role              | Responsibilities                                                                                                      |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Team Leader**   | - Handles all communication with organizers<br> - Registers the team<br> - Submits deliverables on behalf of the team |
| **Programmer**    | - Codes the robot logic, algorithms, image processing (if applicable)                                                 |
| **Hardware Lead** | - Works on circuit connections, sensor integration, actuator control                                                  |
| **Documenter**    | - Manages report writing, presentation slides, video submissions, and logs                                            |

> 🟢 Best practice: Even if each member has a primary role, all team members should **understand all parts** of the project to ensure flexibility and resilience.

---

### 📧 3. **Email and Registration**

* Each team member must register using **a unique and personal email ID**.
* **No shared or duplicate emails are allowed** across teams or individuals.
* Each participant can be a member of **only one team**.

> 🔴 Violation: If one participant signs up with two different email IDs in two teams → **Disqualification**.

---

### 🔒 4. **Team Lock-In Rules**

Once the team is registered:

* **No changes** can be made to team composition.
* You **cannot**:

  * Replace a member
  * Add a new member
  * Swap members between teams

This is to ensure **fairness, accountability**, and consistent team performance across the competition timeline.

---

### 🧑‍🎓 5. **Eligibility Criteria**

* Team members can be from:

  * Undergraduate programs (BE, BTech, BSc, BCA, Diploma, etc.)
  * Some tracks may allow:

    * Postgraduate students (MTech, MSc, etc.)
    * Faculty members or working professionals (for specific themes or non-student tracks)

> 🔍 During registration, each participant must choose the correct category (student or non-student). This affects their **theme assignment** and **hardware eligibility**.

---

### 🛠️ 6. **Skill Set Recommendations**

Although e‑Yantra encourages beginners, a strong team typically includes:

* **1–2 members good at programming** (C, Python, Embedded C)
* **1 member with electronics or robotics hardware understanding**
* **1 member good at communication, writing, video editing (for deliverables)**

> 💡 Even if no one has robotics experience, the competition starts with **training modules**, so everyone learns from scratch.

---

### 🧩 7. **Other Important Notes**

* Team leaders must ensure timely submissions (videos, code, reports) and attend all briefings/webinars.
* All communication from e‑Yantra will be sent **only to the team leader**’s registered email ID.
